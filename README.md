Just run this script in a python command line and follow the instructions

To use different play modes uncomment the commented out code chunks for different A.I decisions in the "hitOrStay" function. 
Make sure when you uncomment a section to the comment out the section that was being used before. 

You can also tweak the numbers at the bottom of the script to change the number of times run etc.
